        <b>Python is Object-Oriented − </b>Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.<br /><br />
        <b>Python is a Beginner's Language − </b>Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.<br /><br />
